Smart contract for renting the house directly through use of blockchain contracts on ethereum.


##### The code is giving me error while i am trying to deploy it into the  remix VM.####

Edit: I am constantly getting following error:

"creation of MyHouse errored: Error encoding arguments: Error: invalid address (argument="address", value="", code=INVALID_ARGUMENT, version=address/5.5.0) (argument=null, value="", code=INVALID_ARGUMENT, version=abi/5.5.0)"

I don't know what i am doing wrong. The code compiles without error but its not being able to deploy. Someone help with the code and provide explanation please.
